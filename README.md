# Project
 Program "Project" is using to download pages from domains such as: olx, otodom, gratka, morizon and domiporta.
 Project contains three main parts of subprograms: 'get_download_offers' and the others two in download_data_app folder - 'gratka_mori_domi_download_data' and 'olx_otodom_download_data'.
 
 'get_download_offers' subprogram downloads pages from domains mentioned above and saves them into a file (it uses httrack program).
 'gratka_mori_domi_download_data' and 'olx_otodom_download_data' subprograms are used to extract a data from saved pages and save that data into a database file.
 
 Each of this programs are using a libraries from the internet and from libraries folder where scripts are coded by me.
 Programs are using settings file where need to be set a paths before start a program.
 
 Variables and their names in programs have been slightly changed to protect this information.
